# Hortiradar

The [Hortiradar][] is a project by the [Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam][VU] in
cooperation with [BIGt&u][]. The main goal is providing the Dutch horticulture
and floriculture industries with valuable insights from social media. To this
end we're building an analytics platform for Twitter data.

See `docs/hortiradar.org` for an overview of the design of the Hortiradar.
