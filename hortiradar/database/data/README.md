The wordlists here contain keywords in lemmatised form (by Frog) followed by a
comma and the part of speech. The available part of speech tags are described in
[Frog's manual](https://github.com/LanguageMachines/frog/raw/master/docs/frogmanual.pdf).

The lemmatised forms are generally in lowercase, only capitalized if they're
names. Clean wordlists with the `clean_wordlist` function in `keywords.py`.
